The challenge is to build a contract Q&A RAG system for Lizzy AI. Lizzy AI is an artificial contract assistant built by an Israeli startup that can draft and review contracts faster. For example, it can do summarization, find logical errors and missing clauses and generate clauses as a chat add on in a working space like Microsoft Word. It is built on many LLMs including GPT-4 trained on a wide variety of legal documents like contracts and case-law. 
The goal of this challenge is to build, evaluate and improve a RAG system for contract Q&A whereby users can chat with a contract and ask questions about the contract.
The RAG is built with LangChain, Chroma DM, and OpenAI API and GPT 3.5-Turbo model.
