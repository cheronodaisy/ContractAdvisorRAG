# Contract Q&A RAG System

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a Contract Q&A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system similar to Lizzy AI, an artificial contract assistant developed by an Israeli startup. Lizzy AI can draft and review contracts quickly, providing functionalities such as summarization, error detection, clause generation, and more. This challenge aims to create, evaluate, and improve a RAG system that allows users to interact with contracts and ask questions about them.

## Features
- **Interactive Q&A**: Allow users to chat with the system and ask questions about the contract.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with LLMs.
- **Chroma**: Vector database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides access to GPT-3.5-Turbo for language processing.
- **GPT-4**: Used for advanced language understanding and generation.
